# Migrating-Data-from-Old-to-New-GDB-Templates
This Notebook project addresses issues where old data in an old template needs to be migrated to a new template.  This involves mapping layers with different names; fields with different names; and domain issues.  This notebook also addresses fields in different Date formats; and migration from old to new COGO Direction formats.
